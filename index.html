      <h4><i>What is a Favicon?</i></h4>
      <p>A favicon is a small, 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icon used on web browsers to represent a website or a web page. Favicon is the abbreviated version of â€œfavorite icon". Favicons are displayed on tabs at the top of a web browsers.</p>
      <h4><i>How are favicons created?</i></h4>
      <p>Favicons are design using an editor like Fireworks, Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop, Pixlr, Google sheets, Execel or photopea.</p>
      <h4><i>How did I create the favicon for this site?</i></h4>
      <p>I created my Favicon through the program, Google sheets. I filled in each cell of the 25x27 box I was given. I filled in the background with blue and created an outline of a duck with yellow. I took a screenshot of the icon I created file saving it as 'Favicon big'. I then opened up the application, Photopea. I opened the file 'Favicon big' in Photopea and set the size of the image to 32x32 and then saved it as 'Favicon small'. I then exported the files and upload them to replit.</p>
